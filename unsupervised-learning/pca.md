## Principal Component Analysis

Definition of PCA: 

* Systemized way to transform input features into principal components
* Use principal components as new features
* PCs are directions in data that maximize variance\(minimize information loss\) when you project/compress down onto them
* More variance of data along a PC, higher that PC is ranked
* Most variance/most informatioon --&gt; first PC
  * second-most variance\(without overlapping with first PC\) --&gt; second PC
