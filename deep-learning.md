Great learning resources include:

* Coursera’s [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) course by [Andrew Ng](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg)
  . This is the one I started with. Starts with regression then moves to classification and neural networks.
* Coursera’s [Neural Networks for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks) by [Geoffrey Hinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton)
  . More focused on neural networks and its visual applications.
* Stanford’s [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-PvXUjD6qg&list=PLlJy-eBtNFt6EuMxFYRiNRS07MCWN5UIA) by [Andrej Karpathy](https://twitter.com/karpathy)
  . It’s interesting to see some advanced concepts and the state of the art in visual recognition using deep neural networks.
* The [Neural Network Zoo](http://www.asimovinstitute.org/neural-network-zoo/) is a great resource to learn more about the different types of neural networks.
