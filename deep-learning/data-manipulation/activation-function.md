### Softmax

The softmax function is also a type of sigmoid function but is handy when we are trying to handle classification problems. The sigmoid function as we saw earlier was able to handle just two classes. What shall we do when we are trying to handle multiple classes. Just classifying yes or no for a single class would not help then. The softmax function would squeeze the outputs for each class between 0 and 1 and would also divide by the sum of the outputs.
