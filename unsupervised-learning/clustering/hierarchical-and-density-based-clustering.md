Hierarchiical

In **single linkage** hierarchical clustering, the distance between two clusters is defined as the shortest distance between two points in each cluster.

In **complete linkage** hierarchical clustering, the distance between two clusters is defined as the longest distance between two points in each cluster.

In **average linkage** hierarchical clustering, the distance between two clusters is defined as the average distance between each point in one cluster to every point in the other cluster.
