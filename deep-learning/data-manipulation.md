**One Hot Encoding**:

One variable for each class like in binary numbers where all numbers are represented by 1 or 0. If its one class then we can say its 0 or 1. But if its multiple classes then each class will have a variable.

The main reason why we use sigmoid function is because it exists between **\(0 to 1\). **Therefore, it is especially used for models where we have to **predict the probability **as an output.Since probability of anything exists only between the range of **0 and 1, **sigmoid is the right choice.The function is **differentiable **.That means, we can find the slope of the sigmoid curve at any two points.
