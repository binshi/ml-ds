### Curse of Dimensionality {#curse-of-dimensionality}

* High dimensional data **restricts the choice **of data processing methods.
* A statistically optimal way of dimensionality reduction is to project the data onto a lower-dimensional orthogonal subspace that **captures as much of the variations of the data as possible**. The most widely used method of this sort is PCA \(**Principal Component Analysis**\).
* Drawback of PCA is however that it is **computationally expensive **to calculate as the dimensions of data increases.
