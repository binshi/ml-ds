## Independent Component Analysis

[Independent component analysis: algorithms and applications](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.322.679&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

The method originated from [signal processing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/mathematics/signal-processing) research, where unknown signal sources are mixed to a new set of signals. This general objective of separating signals into pure sources is called blind source separation \(BSS\).

Independent Component Analysis is a well established and reliable statistical method that performs signal separation. Signal separation is a frequently occurring problem and is central to Statistical Signal Processing, which has a wide range of applications in many areas of technology ranging from Audio and Image Processing to Biomedical Signal Processing, Telecommunications, and Econometrics.

Imagine being in a room with a crowd of people and two speakers giving presentations at the same time. The crowed is making comments and noises in the background. We are interested in what the speakers say and not the comments emanating from the crowd. There are two microphones at different locations, recording the speakers' voices as well as the noise coming from the crowed. Our task is to separate the voice of each speaker while ignoring the background noise
