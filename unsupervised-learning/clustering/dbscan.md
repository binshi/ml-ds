[Visualizing DBSCAN Clustering](https://www.naftaliharris.com/blog/visualizing-dbscan-clustering/)

Based on a set of points \(letâ€™s think in a bidimensional space as exemplified in the figure\), DBSCAN groups together points that are close to each other based on a distance measurement \(usually Euclidean distance\) and a minimum number of points. It also marks as outliers the points that are in low-density regions.
