#### Feedforward

Feedforward is the process neural networks use to turn the input into an output.

#### Backpropagation

Now, we're ready to get our hands into training a neural network. For this, we'll use the method known as**backpropagation**. In a nutshell, backpropagation will consist of:

* Doing a feedforward operation.
* Comparing the output of the model with the desired output.
* Calculating the error.
* Running the feedforward operation backwards \(backpropagation\) to spread the error to each of the weights.
* Use this to update the weights, and get a better model.
* Continue this until we have a model that is good.
